# DNS Abuse SIG

## Mission

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical part of the Internet, including mapping domain names to IP addresses. Malicious threat actors use domain names, their corresponding technical resources, and other parts of the DNS infrastructure, including its protocols, for their malicious cyber operations. CERTs are confronted with reported DNS Abuse on a continuous basis, and rely heavily on DNS analysis and infrastructure to protect their constituencies. Understanding the international customary norms applicable for detecting and mitigating DNS Abuse from the perspective of the global incident response community is critical for the open Internet’s stability, security and resiliency.

The mission of the DNS Abuse SIG is to aid incident responders and security teams with the language and essential knowledge to combat DNS Abuse.


## Goals & Deliverables

1. Provide globally-accessible descriptions and definitions of DNS Abuse in an operational context for purposes of global policy recommendations.
2. Develop and maintain a classification scheme for DNS Abuse.
3. Identify common tools, techniques, and practices of malicious DNS Abuse threat actors.
4. Identify the relevant stakeholders for DNS Abuse detection, prevention, and mitigation.
5. Outline possible best practices for effective detection, prevention, and mitigation of DNS Abuse for the relevant stakeholders.
7. Organize and/or participate in meetings, conferences, and other events on DNS Abuse.


## DNS Abuse Techniques Matrix

Our first major publication is a matrix of DNS Abuse Techniques and Stakeholders:

 - <a href="DNS-Abuse-Techniques-Matrix_v1.3.pdf">DNS-Abuse-Techniques-Matrix_v1.3.pdf</a>

The advice currently takes the form of a matrix indicating whether a specific stakeholder can directly help with a specific technique. By “help”, we mean whether the stakeholder is in a position to detect, mitigate, or prevent the abuse technique. We have organized this information under three spreadsheets covering these incident response actions. For example, during an incident involving DNS cache poisoning, the team can go to the mitigation tab and look at the row for DNS cache poisoning, to find which stakeholders they might be able to contact to help mitigate the incident.

Thanks is given in the document, which is the result of collaboration between many people representing a wide of range roles in the DNS industry.

### HTML version

A version has been produced by JPCERT/CC in HTML form, hosted on GitHub:

 - <a href="https://firstdotorg.github.io/dns-abuse-sig/">https://firstdotorg.github.io/dns-abuse-sig/</a>

### Japanese Translation

We have a Japanese version of the document available here:

 -  <a href="DNS-Abuse-Techniques-Matrix_v1.1-ja.pdf">DNS-Abuse-Techniques-Matrix_v1.1-ja.pdf</a>

### Uses of The DNS Abuse Techniques Matrix

The Matrix has been incoporated into other work elsewhere:

 - <a href="https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy#first-dns-abuse-techniques-matrix">MISP Galaxy</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/blob/main/extension-definition-specifications/incident-ef7/Incident%20Extension%20Suite.adoc#44-event-type-vocabulary">STIX Event Type Vocabulary</a>


## Meetings and Communication

We currently have a regularly scheduled weekly meeting every two weeks on Thursdays at 21:00 JST. Please note that JST doesn't follow daylight savings, so for half the world this will change twice a year. Most regular communication is done through the Slack channel, but we also have a <a href="mailto:dns-abuse-sig@first.org">mailing list</a> for members which is used for more official discussion and in cases where we need to reach the entire SIG.

## Membership and Joining the SIG

FIRST members are automatically approved to join the SIG, and outside members are welcome to apply from the technical and academic communities in research or operational roles that work with DNS and DNS Abuse. Applications from non-FIRST members must be approved by the SIG chairs.

In general, the SIG is a technical group rather than a policy group. Policy items that impact anti-abuse efforts are obviously relevant to SIG work, however the scope of SIG work is primarily technical advice about how to navigate the existing policy landscape.

If you're interested in joining, please check out the <a href="policies">policies page</a>, which includes details on sharing information and our Code of Conduct.
